Bomberlad Galaxy, notes for developers

The map is a square grid of tiles. The tile in the upper left-hand
corner has coordinates (0, 0).

Map-space is a two-dimensional space that is mapped onto a sphere.
Let mapSpace be the size of the map in map-space, i.e., the number
of tiles on one edge times the edge length of a tile.

Initially, the map tile (0, 0) has map-space coordinate
(-0.5 * mapSize, 0.5 * mapSize).

We call the rectangular region with corners
(-0.5 * mapSize, 0.5 * mapSize) and (0.5 * mapSize, -0.5 * mapSize)
the mapping domain.
The mapping domain is mapped (projected) onto a sphere.
Vertices outside the mapping domain are wrapped around.

To this end, every vertex in the mapping domain is assigned relative
st-coordinates ("texture-coordinate") in the range [0, 1].

Then, the texture-coordinates are converted to uv-coordinates, which
parameterize a sphere. The conversion is such that a center region
of size (2 * PI) x (2 * PI) is mapped on the front side of the sphere.

The sphere can be "rotated" by moving the map origin.
